Oracle Java JDK Installaiton on Linux
-------------------------------------

      sudo mkdir /usr/lib/jvm

Copy
If the /usr/lib/jvm folder does not exist, this command will create the directory. If you already have this folder, you can ignore this step and move to next step.

Step 3:
Enter the following command to change the directory.

        cd /usr/lib/jvmCopy

Step 4:
Extract the jdk-8u291-linux-x64.tar.gz file in that directory using this command.

sudo tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/jdk-8u291-linux-x64.tar.gz

Copy
According to this command, the JDK filename is
jdk-8u291-linux-x64.tar.gz and which is located in the ~/Downloads folder. If your downloaded file is in any other location, change the command according to your path.

Enter the following commands to inform the system about the Java's location. Depending on your JDK version, the paths can be different.

sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_281/bin/java" 0

Copy

sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_281/bin/javac" 0

Copy

sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_281/bin/java

Copy

sudo update-alternatives --set javac /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_281/bin/javac

Copy

Step 8:
To verify the setup enter the following commands and make sure that they print the location of java and javac as you have provided in the previous step.

update-alternatives --list java

Copy

update-alternatives --list javac

Copy

Another points

Set JAVA_HOME / PATH for a single user

Login to your account and open .bash_profile file
$ vi ~/.bash_profile

Set JAVA_HOME as follows using syntax export JAVA_HOME=<path-to-java>. If your path is set to /usr/java/jdk1.5.0_07/bin/java, set it as follows:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_07/bin/java

Set PATH as follows:
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_07/bin

Feel free to replace /usr/java/jdk1.5.0_07 as per your setup. Save and close the file. Just logout and login back to see new changes. Alternatively, type the following command to activate the new path settings immediately:
$ source ~/.bash_profile

OR
$ . ~/.bash_profile

Verify new settings:
$ echo $JAVA_HOME
$ echo $PATH

Tip: Use the following command to find out exact path to which java executable under UNIX / Linux:
$ which java
